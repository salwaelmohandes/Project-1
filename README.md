# Project 1
 A Random Quote Generator

### Reflection
 I am going for the exceed expectations.
 I created an array of objects to store the different properties of the quotes.
 I also added an additional property "type" to one of the objects.
 I added the new property to the HTML string to display it if its exist.
 I changed the CSS file and added the new property to it.
 I got a random quote from the quotes array.
 I displays a new quote each time the user clicks the button
 I then updates the quote automatically with the background in regular intervals.
 I updated the background color to a random color. 
 I added some comments to JavaScript file.
